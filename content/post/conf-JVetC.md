A fun math undergraruatelevel talk which uses classic Nintendo game levels as a mean to introduce the fundamental questions and concepts of the theory of computational complexity.

*Talk given as part of the ClubMath conference series at Université de Montréal*

*Based to a certain extent on the delightful paper of Greg Aloupis et al.* : [Classic Nintendo Games are (Computationally) Hard] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1895)

# Abstract

Suppose that an ill-intentioned, but quite skilled individual wished to create a particularly strange and difficult video game level. So hard, in fact, that even the most powerful computers would take years clear it... could he do it, and more importantly, how?

This ludic question shall serve as an entry point for our light-hearted exploration of complexity theory and some of its famous results. With the help of these tools, we will see that most video games, properly generalized, are actually NP-hard. In other words, our hypothetic individual could quite easily achieve his dark goals...
