An introductory talk on MCMC methods, aimed at graduate mathematics or statistics students (or really anybody who happens to have some basic knowledge in stochastic processes).

*Talk given as part of the 2017-2018 graduate students seminar at Université de Montréal*


# Abstract

We all know (or at least used to know!) how to find the stationnary distribution of a given Markov Chain, but how could we, inversely, create a Markov Chain with a given stationnary distribution? How can we generate random numbers from a complicated distribution without knowing its cumulative distribution function, nor its complete density? How can we use the variance of a distribution to better simulate it, in order to actually estimate its said variance ?

These questions, and many others, have paved the way for the short history of Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithms (MCMC). These precious modern statistical tools are remarkable not only because of their inherent ingeniosity and practical aplicability, but also because of the interesting probability problems they pose. This talk will cover from scratch the purpose and properties of these crafty little objects.

# Slides

Here are the [slides](https://res.cloudinary.com/ngg/image/upload/v1529872299/pdfs/mcmc_intro.pdf) for the second part of the talk. The first part, where I introduced Monte-Carlo methods in general and Bayesian statistics, was made on the blackboard.
